### About
This is a full stack web app utilizing Express and Node.js for the backend.  This application finds a halfway destination (ie. coffee shop, restaurant, bar, etc) between two addresses by consuming the Google Maps Geolocation, Directions,  and Places API.  The inspiration for this app came from being frustrated with trying to find an actual halfway destination between myself and my friends. 

### Technologies Used
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Express/Node.js
* AJAX
* Google Maps Directions API

### Features
